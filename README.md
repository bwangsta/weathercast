<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Demo](https://bwangsta.github.io/weathercast/)

This project is the same as the [Weathering](https://github.com/bwangsta/weathering) project except I built this using React. The purpose of this project was to create a weather application that can receive and display data from the Open-Meteo API. I decided to build the same project, but instead use React to get more practice using React.

## Built With

- React
- Javascript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone this project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bwangsta/weathercast.git`
```

2. Install required dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Type in a city in the search bar and the webpage will display its current weather and its future forecast. Click between the daily and hourly button to see the daily or hourly forecast. Swipe left and right on the forecast to see more. Click on the temperature unit button to toggle between displaying the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Click on the volume button to toggle the weather sound effects that match the location's current weather.

## Roadmap

- [x] Dynamically change background image based on location's current weather
- [x] Show the time of the location queried
- [x] Transition to another free weather API
- [x] Show search results when there are cities with the same names and allows user to select which one they want
- [x] Add hourly forecast for the next 24 hours
- [x] Add button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius
- [x] Add sound effects based on the weather
- [x] Add animations
- [ ] Display weather based on user's location by default
- [ ] Add more weather statistics
- [ ] Swap between day and night background images depending on sunrise/sunset time
